    "text": "Summary\nRainfall patterns this year drove water quality patterns at all stations. Large rainfall events in March, May, and in the fall with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole resulted in low air temperatures, rising water temperatures, and drops in salinity. Late spring through the summer months had very little rain, which increased salinity and chlorophyll a levels at all sites. Chlorophyll a was especially high at Pine Island, in which record high monthly chlorophyll a values were observed for several months. This site also had an annual geometric mean of chlorophyll a over the state threshold value of 6.6 \\(\\mu\\)g/L for the second year in the record (2002-2022).\nHurricanes Ian and Nicole brought lots of rainfall and oxygenated water into the entire GTM estuary along with high water levels. Observing potential recovery within two weeks after the storm revealed that many sites did return to pre-storm values or ranges during both events. Seasonal “king tide” events continue to make hurricane impacts during the fall difficult to interpret for “recovery” as these king tides bring higher than high tides into northeast Florida.\nPrior to this year, temperatures at the weather station only fell below -4 °C on two days: January 24, 2003 (for 6.5 hours, the longest duration below this threshold) and December 14, 2010. This year, temperatures fell below -4°C early on the morning of December 25th for 3 hours."

    "text": "The System-Wide Monitoring System\nUnderstanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve.

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at www.nerrsdata.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

The precipitation sensor measured 15-min totals. Historically, a CR10x-2M logger was used to collect meteorological data. The CR10X-2M logger sampled all weather station sensors every 5 sec and calculated both hourly and daily averages for air temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Additionally, instantaneous samples of these parameters were recorded every 15 min. Precipitation data were summed and recorded as 15-minute, hourly, and daily totals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Weather Station at Pellicer Creek during a monthy data download and station cleaning and maintenance in September, 2020.\n\n\nA maximum four-week sampling interval (i.e., time between data downloads) was used to avoid losing data and to provide for regular inspection and maintenance of the station. At each visit to the station, sensor performance was checked by comparing weather station values to those of a handheld Kestrel 4000 wind/weather instrument. All sensors were inspected for damage or debris and repaired and cleaned accordingly after the download of data were downloaded to a Palm Pilot. Except for the rain gauge (which was calibrated in-house), all sensors were removed and sent to Campbell Scientific for re-calibration when appropriate. In addition to data obtained directly from the data logger, data were also transmitted via Campbell Scientific telemetry equipment to a NOAA GOES satellite hourly."

    "text": "2.2 Water quality – continuous\nThe continuous water quality stations were equipped with YSI 6-Series Multiparameter (2003-2015) and YSI EXO2 (2015-present) data sondes. The sondes were anchored within a 10-cm (inside diameter) PVC housing pipe mounted vertically onto a piling. Either a steel pin at the bottom of the pipe held the sonde at a position within 1 m from the bottom, or the sonde was suspended by a chain or rope such that the sensor portion of the sonde extended beyond the end of the PVC housing 1 m from the bottom. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2-cm holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe. Hole density was greatest near the base where the sonde sensors were located.\nData sonde exchanges at all stations were made at approximately two-week intervals and usually took less than five minutes. The inside of each deployment tube was scraped clean with a customized tool prior to the deployment of the newly calibrated sonde. All calibration, post-deployment readings, and reconditioning of the sondes and sensors were performed in accordance with the methods outlined in the standard operating procedures for the sonde model, in addition to procedures created by the NERRS CDMO (NERRS, 2013).\nData sondes collected temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth (water depth above instrument placement), and turbidity data at 30-min intervals, beginning at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring stations in December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek monitoring stations in February 2002. In January 2007, the NERRS changed from collecting continuous data at 30-min intervals to 15-min intervals. Data used in this report contain both sampling intervals."

Grab samples were collected from all stations in duplicate using a pole sampler and bucket. Diel samples were only collected at the Pellicer Creek station at 2.5-hour intervals for a 25-hour (lunar day) period using a Teledyne ISCO automatic sampler equipped with an internal ice bath to keep samples cold.

    "text": "From 2003–2006, SWMP data underwent a two-step QA/QC process (secondary and tertiary) using protocols outlined in the CDMO’s Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2006). The secondary QA/QC process was performed by GTMNERR staff and involved performing basic statistical analysis, processing the data using macros distributed by the CDMO, and plotting data to look for suspect or anomalous data. Anomalous data were evaluated to determine whether values were: 1) outside the expected range for the site, or 2) outside the range of measurements established by YSI for the sensors. Data were investigated for validity based on weather and field observations, quality control checks, graphs, and instrument diagnostics. Yearly data files were compiled, and data were deleted if anomalies were attributed to sensor malfunctions. Other anomalous data were marked as suspect in the accompanying yearly metadata document. Both the annual data file and metadata were submitted to the CDMO for archiving and review. The CDMO evaluated the reserve’s findings by performing a tertiary review process. The tertiary process included evaluating the files for completeness, ensuring that supporting documentation was submitted, and offering suggestions for improvements to the data. All data files collected prior to 2007 are referred to as “historic” data files by the CDMO. Beginning in January 2007 and continuing to present, all SWMP data files undergo a three-step QA/QC protocol outlined in the CDMO Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2015). In addition to the secondary and tertiary processes listed above, data files undergo a primary QA/QC process, in which an automated QA/QC is performed by the CDMO upon the upload of the raw data file using the CDMO’s Data Upload Service.\nOnce tertiary review is completed for data files, they are referred to as “authenticated” data. All data files used in this report have been authenticated with the exception of nutrient data collected in 2013 and 2015-present, which have not undergone tertiary review. Historic data files were edited to include the updated QA/QC protocols that were implemented by the CDMO in 2007. Standardized QA/QC flags and codes were applied to the historic data files using finalized metadata reports. These files were updated to include suspect data flags and codes to keep consistency among all data files. Rejected and suspect data were removed from the data files prior to analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll water quality and weather data used in this report are downloadable through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office using their data portals. However, much of the nutrient data presented in this report is not fully available through the CDMO.

In 2022, the GTM Research Reserve weather station recorded much higher rainfall in the first quarter (January-March) than the previous five years (Figure 4.1 (a)). The majority of this rainfall occurred during the month of March with approximately 200 mm (7.87 in) of rain (Figure 4.1 (b)).\nWith the exception of a single 24-hr period on May 21, 2022 that resulted in 87.1 mm (3.43 in) of rain, the spring and summer months were rather dry with no “extremely wet” days of rainfall (&gt;30mm) and very few “very wet” days (20-29mm). In fact, mid-July through mid-August saw almost a month with no rainfall (Figure 4.1 (c)). Regular rain resumed in late August into September concluding with extreme precipitation during Hurricane Ian (Chapter 7), which contributed to September having the largest amount of monthly rainfall for the year with 400 mm (15.7 in) of rain.\nEven though another tropical cyclone event, Hurricane Nicole (Chapter 8), occurred in November, the fourth quarter rainfall levels were still within similar amounts to the previous few years (Figure 4.1 (a)).

    "text": "4.2 Temperature\nTemperature fluctuations were observed outside of normal ranges several times throughout the year (Figure 4.2 (a)). The most variable ranges occurred in the first quarter of the year with several cold days in January and a very clear drop in temperature with the rainstorms in March 2022. The beginning of January had several hotter than average days. Several distinctive drops in average temperature were observed in the last quarter associated with storm events (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Nicole, and nor’easters) (Figure 4.2 (a)).\nFreezing temperatures are of great interest in northeast Florida because the region is a climatic transition zone experiencing a shift in foundational vegetation species associated with temperature (Zomlefer, Judd, and Giannasi 2006; Williams et al. 2014; Rodriguez, Feller, and Cavanaugh 2016; Cavanaugh et al. 2019). Salt marsh grasses are out-competed by mangrove trees/shrubs in the absence of freezes, which limit mangrove persistence. Mangrove coverage has continued to increase throughout Northeast Florida from an estimated four acres in 1990 to almost 3,000 acres in 2014 (Dix et al. 2021).\n\n\nMangroves and salt marsh in wetlands near Washington Oaks Gardens State Park and Matanzas State Forest in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nCavanaugh et al. (2013) observed an ecological threshold of -4 °C, where mangrove cover decreased in years that experienced temperatures below -4 °C. Prior to this year, temperatures at the weather station only fell below -4 °C on two days: January 24, 2003(for 6.5 hours, the longest duration below this threshold) and December 14, 2010. This year, temperatures fell below -4°C early on the morning of December 25th for 3 hours (Figure 4.2 (b)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEvery one of the freeze events (2003, 2010, and this year) occurred in the early morning hours between 4-8 am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Historical daily range of air temperature at the SWMP weather station with current year daily average overlaid in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Continuous, 15-min air temperature values between December 23-27, 2022 with air temperature values recorded below -4 degrees Celsius, threshold provided with a dashed horizontal line, indicated in red.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Air temperature recoreded at the SWMP weather station.\n\n\nSimilar to air temperature, water temperature was also quite variable in the first quarter of the year (January - March) where daily averages were much lower in the end of January. However, water temperatures in March ended up being higher than air temperatures, likely due to the added freshwater from the rains in March (Figure 4.1; Figure 4.3). Water temperatures do not experience the range in values that are observed in the air, although similar observable drops in temperature in the early and late parts of the year were visible (Figure 4.3).\nBeginning in the latter part of May through the entire summer, with little to no rain events, waters were much warmer than average, particularly in the shallower sites (Figure 4.3 (a); Figure 4.3 (d)). There was an observable drop in water temperatures at all sites during the time Hurricane Ian struck the Florida peninsula in late September, but temperatures climbed back into their “normal” range after the storm passed at all sites except Pellicer Creek (Figure 4.3), which is a shallow creek and more influenced by upland runoff.

High chlorophyll a at all stations in January was likely due to high temperatures in the early part of that month (Figure 4.3). San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek continued to see high chlorophyll at those sites (Figure 5.4 (b); Figure 5.4 (d)).\nAlthough much higher seasonal chlorophyll was observed at Fort Matanzas in the first quarter, August was much lower than average (Figure 5.3 (c)).

Additionally, the five months in 2022 in which the highest monthly values of chlorophyll a were recorded were identified in the residual “events” that were high, they were not the highest deviations in the timeseries; that value occurred in 2015 (Figure 5.5 (a)). All other stations observed lower annual variability in 2022 and each station shows a distinctive seasonal pattern with the highest values occurring from April through August, particularly at Pine Island and Pellicer Creek (Figure 5.5). San Sebastian and Fort Matanzas, likely due to their proximity to inlets, appear to have a more protracted season which further extends into October (Figure 5.5 (b); Figure 5.5 (c)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Phytoplankton variability at each of the four SWMP water quality stations.

    "text": "5.3 Nitrogen\nInterpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated (see below). However, there is a pattern in total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) at all sites (Figure 5.8). At Pine Island, there are very low values between January-March and elevated levels from April-July (Figure 5.8 (a)). This distinctive shift between March and April may likely be in response to the large amounts of rainfall (Section 4.1) the system experienced in March (Figure 4.1 (b)). This response was seen at all the other sites, especially Pellicer Creek, which is also a more brackish site and sensitive to upland freshwater deposition (Figure 5.8 (b)).\nThere was enough data in the last quarter of the year at Pine Island to show high TN values in September, which exceeded the threshold, though fell within normal ranges for that month (Figure 5.6 (a)). High TN in April at Pellicer Creek, coupled with the high chlorophyll a values in this same time, could be a consequence of the large rain the area experienced during March (Figure 4.1 (b); Figure 5.6 (d)).\nAll DIN above detection limit were reported less than 0.1 (mg/L) at all sites for all months this year. The higher values appear to be in months following large rain events such as October at Pellicer Creek (Figure 5.7 (d)) and in April at San Sebastian (Figure 5.7 (b)) and Fort Matanzas (Figure 5.7 (c)).\n\n5.3.1 Total Nitrogen\nTN is a calculated value based on TKN and NO23.\nThis year, several of the NO23 values fell below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Central Lab’s minimum detection limit and therefore TN was not able to be calculated and is missing for quite a few months at all the stations (Figure 5.6).

For the two stations furthest away from the inlets (Pine Island and Pellicer Creek), salinity started to increase with each tidal cycle starting on Wednesday, September 28th, 2022. The predominating northeasterly winds along the northeast Florida coast at this time largely fought falling tides, trapping more salty, ocean waters within the estuary.\nAll sites experienced drops in salinity as the storm passed, but the greatest effect was in Pellicer Creek where salinity dropped to 0 psu (fresh water) for four days before any observable rise in salinity was observed by the station. Quite a bit of freshwater movement and draining from the watershed is observable at the other three stations in the days after the storm (Figure 7.5). Large changes (peaks and drops) in salinity at Fort Matanzas is most likely due to the influence of Pellicer Creek, the largest freshwater source to the Matanzas Estuary, as well as the proximity of this site to the Matanzas Inlet (4 km north). The Pine Island station appeared to have increased in salinity with the storm and then fell back to pre-storm levels within a day and a half after the storm’s passing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Continuous salinity at all four water quality stations of the GTMNERR during the time period of Hurricane Ian, September 28 - October 2, 2022.

    "text": "7.5 Recovery\nA large note to make when investigating recovery time frames is that not long after the passing of the hurricane, northeast Florida experienced seasonal “king tide” events, which regularly occur in the fall months (primarily October) and lead to higher than high tides. This effect largely impacts the ability to fully assess the “recovery” of the system after the hurricane. However, observing potential recovery within two weeks after the storm revealed that many sites did return to pre-storm values or ranges (Table 7.1).\nDissolved oxygen at many stations increased with the storm and remained high for several days following the storm. Preceding the storm, much of the estuary was experiencing lower values of dissolved oxygen. The storm appeared to have reoxygenated the waterways, though both Fort Matanzas and San Sebastian experienced a drop in the day after the storm, which then climbed back up to pre-storm levels within a few days. For Pine Island, the dissolved oxygen remained high after the storm and hasn’t fallen back to pre-storm patterns.\nAlthough pre-storm salinity values were reached not long after the storm passed at San Sebastian and Fort Matanzas, the tidal range of salinity did not resume pre-storm patterns until over a week had passed after the storm. This was likely largely driven by the excess freshwater in the estuary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Number of days it took to return to pre-storm values/patterns after the passing of Hurricane Ian at all four water quality stations in the GTM Research Reserve.\n\n\nStation\nSalinity\nDissolved Oxygen\nDepth\n\n\n\n\nPine Island\n1\nNA\n1\n\n\nSan Sebastian\n11\n6\n1\n\n\nFort Matanzas\n12\n4\n1\n\n\nPellicer Creek\n12\n10\n13"

Due to telemetry issues (faulty solar regulator) at this same time, it is likely this was associated with the power comm board failure in the data sonde as it was deployed during the time the telemetry went down (7/16/2022 - 8/5/2022).\nReceived EXO2 datasonde on 10/19/2022 that was sent for service and repair back in August after a failed deployment in the field at Pellicer Creek. The data from the deployment was able to be retrieved once the sonde was hooked up to the computer. Since a post-calibration was able to be performed after the deployment by moving all the sensors to a new sonde body, this retrieved data was able to be uploaded to the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office portal and included in the quarterly QAQC submission for 2022 Q3."

    "text": "9.3 Observable Depth Dropout at Pellicer Creek\nOn 09/20/2022 a depth drop out (i.e., no reported depth data) at the Pellicer Creek WQ station was observed via the NOAA HADS satellite. Maintenance and an evaluation was performed at the site: disconnected and reconnected the telemetry cable and opened and closed the battery compartment on the data sonde. This reset the depth data and the station resumed reporting and transmission to NOAA HADS an hour after the maintenance was performed. Discussions occurred regarding whether this depth drop out (which has been observed sporadically before) could be caused by the telemetry connection, or the program not being able to accommodate non-SWMP tier 1 parameters/sensors: e.g. Total Algae and fDOM."
